## Background
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately. In business-to-consumer marketing, companies often segment customers according to demographics that include: Age,Gender,Marital status,Location (urban, suburban, rural),Life stage (single, married, divorced, empty-nester, retired, etc.),Income.
Segmentation allows marketers to better tailor their marketing efforts to various audience subsets.
 
## Data presentation
> Context

This data set is created only for the learning purpose of the customer segmentation concepts , also known as market basket analysis . I will demonstrate this by using unsupervised ML technique (KMeans Clustering Algorithm) in the simplest form.

> Content

You are owing a supermarket mall and through membership cards, you have some basic data about your customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score.
Spending Score is something you assign to the customer based on your defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data.

> Mall_Customers.csv
> 
This file contains the basic information (ID, age, gender, income, spending score) about the customers
 
## Problem Statement
> 
You own the mall and want to understand the customers like who can be easily converge [Target Customers] so that the sense can be given to marketing team and plan the strategy accordingly.

## Project Objectives

  - How to achieve customer segmentation using machine learning algorithm (KMeans Clustering) in Python in simplest way.
  - Who are your target customers with whom you can start marketing strategy [easy to converse]
  - How the marketing strategy works in real world

## Project Process

1. Step 1: Importing Libraries
2. Step 2: EDA exploratory data analysis
3. Step 3: Hypothesis Testing
4. Step 4: Determining optimum value of K using the Elbow Method
5. Step 5: Build k-means model to segment the customer
